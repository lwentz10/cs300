1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  In project one, the problem that I solved was run-time and memory usage of different data structures in order to determine the efficiency. In project two, the problem tackled was to design a program that can sort and display a list of courses in alphanumeric order.
2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
   I approached the problems by first analyzing the requirements of the two projects and choosing the most appropriate data structures based on what is needed.
3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
   I did struggle with a few roadblocks and when I encountered them, I took a step back and gave myself time to review the problem and check my understanding. I used resources including the course material to help better my understanding and refresh the topics.
4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
   Working on these projects has helped me develop a more thoughtful and strategic approach to software design and programming. These projects have proven the value of planning and testing throughout the development process.
5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
   I have learned how important it is to write clean, organized code so that it is easy to modify and read. This has showed me showed me that maintainable and adaptable code not only makes it easier for others to understand my work but also saves time and effort when updates or debugging are needed later.
